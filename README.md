The goal of this project is to create an interactive UI (user interface) capable of presenting, evaluating and predicting the following fields: consumable usage rates, resupply logistics limitations, accuracy of predictions, resupply schedules, incoming and outgoing crew members schedules, minimum supply threshold and historical actuals. This interface will be derived from a forecast time-series model that should give us an insight on optimum times to resupply along with helping to prepare for inevitable unseen issues that may occur. We plan to accomplish this by making a graph-like interface that presents data for a set period of time and changes overtime based on various inputs. Once the program has data input for said time, based on historical actuals our team will develop formulas allowing the UI to be able to make predictions on what the ISS storage supply will look like over a period of time. We plan for the UI to be able to show our target supply threshold, the minimum supply threshold, along with the predicted actual threshold in total and of various consumables. These features together will allow us to view the estimated amount of time survivable without a resupply as well as any unsuspected shortages of certain consumables. On the expected supply dates you will be able to input various consumable items allowing you to put in more or less of one item opposed to another and see how this affects the ISS consumable supply overtime.
